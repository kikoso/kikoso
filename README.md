### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer originally from Madrid, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, and based in Munich, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. I have been working as a freelancer for more than 5 years, and as a software engineer for 13 years. My main focus is Android and backend with Java and Kotlin. But I can tinker with any technology (I have some experience with Python for backend, RoR, NodeJS, Tensorflow, Scala...)

## Some more background

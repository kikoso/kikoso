### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer originally from Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸, and based in Munich, Germany 🇩🇪. I have been working as a freelancer for more than 9 years, and as a software engineer for 16 years. My main focus is Android and backend with Java and Kotlin. But I can tinker with any technology (I have some experience with Python for backend, RoR, NodeJS, Tensorflow, Scala...)

## Some more background

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Compose, KMP and Kotlin for Backend.
- 💬 Ask me about Android, Java and Kotlin.
